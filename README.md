#CalMeBot
CalMeBot is a group project done in collaboration between four NLP students.Â CalMeBot serves as a calming tool for those in need of assistance. The main goal of our project is to help people with symptoms such as anxiety, stress, anger, or restlessness. Using the complex responses programmed by us, the bot is designed to help people who feel bad at the moment. Comprehensive help was based on therapies between a psychologist and a patient suffering from one of the above-mentioned symptoms.
